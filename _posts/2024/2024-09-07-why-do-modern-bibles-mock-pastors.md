My name is Peirre Pah. The year is 1611 in Neerland. 

A newer version of the Bible was just published. It is expected to eventually replace our dearly beloved old Wycliffe Bible 1382-1395.

Should we allow our old Wycliffe Bible 1382-1395 to be replaced with modern versions?

While studying these modern Bibles I noticed that they are mocking pastors!

<!-- Jeremiah 2:8 -->

<!-- 
> Jeremiah ch 2 v 8
>
> The priests said not, Where is the Lord?
> and they that handle the law knew me not:
> the pastors also transgressed against me,
> and the prophets prophesied by Baal,
> and walked after things that do not profit. 
-->

Why do the modern bibles mock pastors?

Should we allow our old Wycliffe Bible 1382-1395 to be replaced with newer versions which mock pastors?

They are praising pastors in Jeremiah chapter 3 verse 15:

<!-- Jeremiah 3:15 -->

> And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.

But a few pages later, they bombard them with mockery:

<!-- Jeremiah 10:21  -->

> Jeremiah ch 10 v 21 
> 
> For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.

<!-- Jeremiah 12:10 -->

> Jeremiah ch 12 v 10 
>
> Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.

<!-- Jeremiah 22:22 -->

> Jeremiah ch 22 v 22
>
> The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.

<!-- Jeremiah 23:1-2 -->

> Jeremiah ch 23 vv 1-2
>
> Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the LORD.
>
> Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD.
    
 
They are saying that pastors destroy and scatter the flock of God!
 
Bad.
 
The Wycliffe Bible translators never mocked pastors. They were careful not to use the word "pastors" in the book of Jeremiah:

<!-- Jeremiah 23:1 -->

> Jeremiah ch 23 vv 1-2
>
> Woe to the **shepherds**, that scatter and draw the flock of my pasture, saith the Lord.
>
> Therefore the Lord God of Israel saith these things to the **shepherds** that feed my people, Ye have scattered my flock, and have cast them out, and have not visited them; lo! I shall visit on you the malice of your studies, saith the Lord.

It's the shepherds who destroy and scatter the flock of God, not pastors.

Why do the modern bibles mock pastors?
 
Do pastors even know about this?

Bad.
