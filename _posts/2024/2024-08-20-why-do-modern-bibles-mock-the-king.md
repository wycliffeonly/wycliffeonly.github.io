My name is Peirre Pah. The year is 1611 in Neerland. 

A newer version of the Bible was just published. It is expected to eventually replace our dearly beloved old Wycliffe Bible 1382-1395.

Should we allow our old Wycliffe Bible 1382-1395 to be replaced with modern versions?

While studying these modern Bibles I noticed that they are mocking the king!

Why do the modern bibles mock the king?

Should we allow our old Wycliffe Bible 1382-1395 to be replaced with newer versions which mock the king?

They are praising the king in Ecclesiastes chapter 8 verse 4:

<!-- Ecclesiastes 8:4 -->

> Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?

But lots of pages later, in Hosea chapter 8 verse 4, they are mocking the king:

<!-- Hosea 8:4 -->

> They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not

They are saying that kings are not being set up by God!

Bad.

The Wycliffe Bible translators never mocked the king. They were careful not to use the word "king" in Hosea chapter 8 verse 4:

> They reigned, and not of me; they were princes, and I knew not.

Why do the modern bibles mock the king?

Does the king even know about this?

Bad.
